Changes in ownership, civil disputes, and worries about a departure from the winery's traditional, elegant style become distant memories when tasting this powerful but focused wine. Very light oak influence allows the elevated, sun-soaked terroir of Mount Veeder to shine. Acidity is bright, and the wine has tart, juicy black fruits. Herbs and black licorice add nuance, while chewy tannins persist in a lingering finish, which is rich in stony mineral notes. If over-extracted Napa Cabs turned you away from the variety and region, this bottle promises to lure you back in. The 2014 vintage is drinking exceptionally well, but it's still a baby. This wine will mature with grace and elegance and can be left in the cellar for decades.",

In 2003, his apprentice Fred Merwath took over the winery, along with Merwath's college friend and now co-owner, Oskar Bynke. The pair are now making the region's most exciting wines, growing grapes without pesticides and herbicides, and slowly fermenting wines over periods of eight months or more. Grapes for this bottle come from the HJW vineyard, whose aged vines benefit from the moderating effects of nearby Seneca Lake. The site's elevation also provides a cool, prolonged growing season, meaning grapes mature with intensity and finesse and maintain fresh fruit flavors and bracing acidity. This bottle has green apple, white peach, and lemon notes, followed by a lasting, crisp finish. Dry, age-worthy, and absolutely delicious, this is the most stunning Riesling currently being made in America.",

In 2006, after years of extensive planning, research, and soil analysis, he purchased an 11,000-acre estate in the Millahue Valley. Vi�a Vik's flagship Millahue blend contains Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from three different vine clones, planted across three plots. Smaller quantities of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Syrah, and Carmenere complete the wine. The 2013 vintage more than delivers on Vik's vision, with dark berry aromas, followed by dried herbs and floral notes. Bright and energetic on the palate, with spicy tannins, this is a polished wine capable of aging. Not only is this now South America's best wine, it ranks among the finest bottles we tasted all year.",

Grippy tannins work alongside racy acidity in this $25 bottle that will age well for 10 to 15 years at least. This wine proves that Greek Xinomavro can hang with the likes of Barolo and Pinot Noir.

Changes in ownership, civil disputes, and worries about a departure from the winery's traditional, elegant style become distant memories when tasting this powerful but focused wine. Very light oak influence allows the elevated, sun-soaked terroir of Mount Veeder to shine. Acidity is bright, and the wine has tart, juicy black fruits. Herbs and black licorice add nuance, while chewy tannins persist in a lingering finish, which is rich in stony mineral notes. If over-extracted Napa Cabs turned you away from the variety and region, this bottle promises to lure you back in. The 2014 vintage is drinking exceptionally well, but it's still a baby. This wine will mature with grace and elegance and can be left in the cellar for decades.",

The pair are now making the region's most exciting wines, growing grapes without pesticides and herbicides, and slowly fermenting wines over periods of eight months or more. Grapes for this bottle come from the HJW vineyard, whose aged vines benefit from the moderating effects of nearby Seneca Lake. The site's elevation also provides a cool, prolonged growing season, meaning grapes mature with intensity and finesse and maintain fresh fruit flavors and bracing acidity. This bottle has green apple, white peach, and lemon notes, followed by a lasting, crisp finish.

Smaller quantities of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Syrah, and Carmenere complete the wine. The 2013 vintage more than delivers on Vik's vision, with dark berry aromas, followed by dried herbs and floral notes.

Its vineyards surround the Castello di Brolio (Brolio Castle), providing grapes for top-quality, Sangiovese-dominant wines. Cherry and blackcurrant notes have an almost dusty character, complemented by balanced oak aging. This wine is drinking well now and will become even more interesting with age.",

The Oddity coats the palate with a pleasantly chalky mouthfeel, yet there's no lack of fruit � look for an abundance of apricot, peach, and citrus notes on the nose and palate.",
